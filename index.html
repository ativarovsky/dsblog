    <h4> Hi there. I'm Alice and I'm glad you stopped by. </h4>
    <br>
    <p> I created this blog to explore my interest in the intersection of data science and health. Using publicly available health data, I contribute <a href="blog.html">projects</a> spanning the areas of data visualization, biostatistics, epidemiology, machine learning, and more. </p>

## Work
* I started my career as a Chemical Engineer, and later worked as a Supply Chain lead at [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/).
* In May 2020, I completed my Master of Public Health in Epidemiology & Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/).
* I wrote my master's thesis on phthalate exposure in the US using data from the CDC's [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) project. The analysis inspired me to create this site, and you can find the full project up on the blog (PUT LINK). 
* 
* I completed the Health Research Training Program (HRTP) with the [New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page) in summer 2019. I analyzed depression rates across NYC. Check out my final poster [here](practicum.html).
* In Fall 2019, I worked on an [analysis](https://prisrinivasan.github.io/p8105_final/index.html) of associations between childhood asthma prevalence and cockraoch presence in NYC households. 
* In Spring 2020, I was honored to publish a [piece](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/can-we-talk-about-climate-change) about climate change in Columbia's Public Health Now magazine.

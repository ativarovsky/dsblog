* In Fall 2019, I worked on an [analysis](https://prisrinivasan.github.io/p8105_final/index.html) of associations between childhood asthma prevalence and cockraoch presence in NYC households. 
* In Spring 2020, I was honored to publish a [piece](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/can-we-talk-about-climate-change) about climate change in Columbia's Public Health Now magazine.
